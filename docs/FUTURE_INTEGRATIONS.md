# Future Integrations & Ideas

## HEX Database Integration 🔥

**Status:** Access Granted ✅
**Contact:** Already signed up with HEX (personal account)
**Use Cases:**
- People Finder program enhancement
- Digital Footprint program enhancement
- Plan to FUSE these two programs into one super tool

**Target Customers:**
- Local sheriff's office (Dad worked there, have connections)
- Friend who needs footprint wiping (doctor)
- Professional-grade background check tool

**Implementation Priority:** High (once People Finder/Digital Footprint are ready)

**Notes:**
- HEX provides professional database access
- Will significantly upgrade data quality
- Makes the tool enterprise-ready
- Good for selling to law enforcement

## Gemini AI API Integration 🤖

**Status:** API Key Available
**Email:** Isaiahjmiro@gmail.com

**Potential Use Cases:**

### 1. Modeling Program AI Assistant
- Natural language to 3D model generation
- "Make me a cookie cutter of a cat" → generates cat outline
- AI-powered mesh repair suggestions
- Smart parameter recommendations

### 2. People Finder Intelligence
- AI-powered relationship mapping
- Pattern recognition in search results
- Smart data correlation
- Natural language queries

### 3. Digital Footprint Analysis
- AI summary of online presence
- Risk assessment automation
- Privacy recommendation engine
- Threat detection

### 4. ZoolZ Hub Assistant
- Help users navigate programs
- Tutorial generation
- Troubleshooting automation
- Feature recommendations

**Implementation Priority:** Medium (cool feature, not critical)

**Technical Notes:**
- Gemini API supports multimodal (text + images)
- Could analyze cookie cutter images before generation
- Could help with STL file analysis
- Potential for natural language tool control

## Server Deployment Plan 🖥️

**Hardware:** Old Mac desktop
**Method:** Port forwarding
**Purpose:**
- Run ZoolZ as a server
- Multi-user access
- Background task processing
- Email system active

**Security Considerations:**
- Email verification required
- User approval system (admin only)
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- HTTPS/SSL certificates

**Benefits:**
- CPU-intensive tasks run on server
- Users don't overload their own machines
- Centralized user management
- Professional deployment

## People Finder + Digital Footprint Fusion 🔍

**Concept:** Single unified search tool

**Features:**
- Search by name → get people records + digital footprint
- Search by username → get digital presence + real identity
- Cross-reference public records with online activity
- Timeline view of person's digital + physical history

**Data Sources:**
1. Public records (current)
2. Social media (current)
3. HEX database (future)
4. Court records (future)
5. Professional databases (future)

**UI Concept:**
- Single search bar
- Tabbed results (Public Records | Digital Footprint | Timeline | Map)
- Export to comprehensive PDF report
- Professional-grade presentation

## Email System Roadmap 📧

**Phase 1:** (Current)
- Welcome emails for new users
- Password reset emails
- User approval notifications

**Phase 2:** (Server Deployment)
- Task completion notifications
- Weekly digest of activity
- Export ready emails
- System updates

**Phase 3:** (Professional)
- Custom branded emails
- PDF attachments (search results)
- Scheduled reports
- API integration alerts

## Notes for Future Development

**Remember:**
- Keep all integrations modular
- Don't break existing features
- Test on Mac server before full deployment
- Keep API keys in .env file (never commit!)
- Document everything for handoff to sheriff's office

**Priority Order:**
1. Complete Modeling program (90% done)
2. Finish auth system UI
3. Test/optimize People Finder
4. Add HEX integration to People Finder
5. Fuse People Finder + Digital Footprint
6. Deploy to Mac server
7. Add Gemini AI features (nice-to-have)
